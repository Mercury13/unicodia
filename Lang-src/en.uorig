      <p>'''Americal Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)''' is a seven-bit character encoding developed in the USA in 1963. A width of 7 bits was chosen as a compromise for data transfer via telegraph. If it’s too much, ASCII may be easily cut to 6 bits, leaving characters 40…5F and 20…3F. '''Basic Latin''' of Unicode is the same as ASCII, so English Unicode text is readable even in wrong encoding.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The first 32 characters, 00…1F, are [[pt:control|control]], and few of them are used today. They are followed with 95 printable characters. Many of them go back to typewriters: to print À, you need to type A, return carriage one position back, and type backquote. The last character, 7F=DEL, goes back to punched tapes{{-}}holes punched in all tracks tell that the character is punched by mistake and should{{_}}not be read.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Many national variants of ASCII existed: Britain replaced hash # with pound £, USSR dollar $ with coin ¤, Germany [\]{|} with umlauts ÄÖÜäöü, Japan backslash \ with yen ¥…</p>
      <p />
      <p>The rest 128 characters could be filled with everything. One such 8-bit encoding, [[pt:latin1|Latin-1]], also came to Unicode.</p>

      <p>Latin-1 is a second name of 8-bit encoding '''ISO{{_}}8859-1''' introduced in 1987 and extending [[pt:ascii|ASCII]] to European languages.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The first 32 characters, 80…9F, are [[pt:control|control]] for compatibility with 7-bit encodings: early mail programs discarded the upper bit, and it’s infeasible to have [[pt:graphic|printable]] characters here. Nowadays these characters are no longer used as intended and often repurposed for [[pt:private|private-use]]. For example, Windows-1252 is a modified version of Latin-1 where control positions are replaced with typographical characters. It got to the point where World Wide Web standards say: if a page requests ISO{{_}}8859-1, display it in Windows-1252.</p>

     <orig>
      <p>The International Phonetic Alphabet based on Latin is used by linguists, speech therapists, singers and actors to convey transcription of languages. To convey additional speech disorders such as tooth gnashing and lisping, IPA extensions are used.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In reality, most characters of this block are not{{_}}extensions but ordinary IPA: for example, {{sm|ɦ}} is present in Russian “ага” ''(aha)'', Ukrainian “гривня” ''(hryvnia)'' and Czech “hrad”.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Opera singers often sing in unknown languages, and their ability to read transcription signs is often used by dictionary authors. Particularly, the well-known sound “Yanny or Laurel” was recorded by opera singer Jay Aubrey Jones{{-}}low male voice that came through low-quality speaker and microphone of the same quality turned to Yanny.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Also using IPA characters you can turn a text upside-down for a joke.</p>

      <p>Diacritical marks are above-line, below-line and inline characters affixed to letters, and modifying or clarifying their meanings. For example, accent like in ''résumé''.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Unicode provides two ways of conveying diacritics, [[pt:precomposed|precomposed]] characters and combinations “main character +{{_}}'''[[pt:combining|combining]] mark'''”. To simplify search in such a mess, Unicode has an algorithm of [[pt:normalization|normalization]].</p>
      <p />
      <p>Characters 034F CGJ is not{{_}}a{{_}}joiner, but ''disjoiner'' of digraphs. It’s used in Czech (ch is pronounced as {{t|x}}, and alphabetical order is ce &amp;lt;{{_}}c+CGJ+h &amp;lt;{{_}}ci &amp;lt;{{_}}d &amp;lt;{{_}}ch), Hungarian, Hebrew and some other languages.</p>

      <p>Character 0310 Candrabindu is intended for writing Indic languages in Latin and Cyrillic. Every [[pt:brahmic|Indic]] script has its own candrabindu.</p>

      <p>''Mtavruli'' is a capital form of the standard Georgian type ''Mkhedruli''. Capital letters from [[pk:10A0|main block]] are named ''Asomtavruli'' and considered obsolete.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Mtavruli is used in highlights and captions, and for a long time was considered a variant of font. However, scholars found documents from the 19th and early 20th centuries where Mkhedruli and Mtavruli were mixed. Also, Georgian fonts come in pairs, Mkhedruli and Mtavruli, complicating daily work and making Georgian text less expressive if font change is impossible. Michael Everson, a typographer from Consortium, received a translation of ''Alice in Wonderland'' in 8-bit encoding where DRINK ME was typed in Mtavruli.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Now Unicode considers Mkhedruli and Mtavruli as small and capital letters, just with other rules of use{{-}}the entire word is capitalized. The double line below barely visible on the icon is an editorial mark meaning capital letter.</p>

     <orig>
      <p>Optical and magnetic ink character recognition is used for automatic document entry, mostly passports, bank cheques, and transport tickets. Unlike barcodes, the same characters are recognized by both people and machines to diminish fraud. Both technologies use special monospace fonts. These fonts (sometimes in distorted form) are widely used in films and video games of the cyberpunk genre.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In 1956 the USA demonstrated magnetic ink character recognition (MICR). The system understands ten digits and four special characters identifying the field’s meaning. Magnetic recognition is significantly more reliable than optical. If you see a square font where part of the vertical strokes is thick (for example, on the box of ''Magnavox Odyssey'' console){{-}}this is stylized MICR.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In 1968 the USA made the first working technology of optical recognition, OCR-A. Understands the entire [[ps:Latn|Latin]] alphabet with small letters. To separate fields, special characters are used: hook, chair, fork, buckle and bowtie. The font is found in films ''13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi'', ''The Blacklist'', ''The Pretender'', ''Bugs'' and others.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Only in the 1990s font-independent optical recognition was developed. It is used for digitization of books and processing of questionnaires, and is much less reliable. So foreign passport with a machine-readable page written in OCR-B font is not{{_}}an{{_}}anachronism.</p>

     <orig>
      <p>You might ask: how to find a CJK ideograph in the dictionary if you don’t know the pronunciation? The solution is to identify a ''radical''{{-}}a key stroke or component within the character.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Kangxi dictionary of Chinese language was compiled in 1710–1716 under the order of the Kangxi Emperor of China and contains {{n|49030}} entries. It remained the standard reference until the late 19th century. A revised edition of 1831 fixed about {{n|2500}} mistakes caused by the hurry of initial authors.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The system of “alphabetical” sorting of ideographs by 214 radicals was first devised in 1615. However, it was the Kangxi dictionary that ultimately standardized that method.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The sample Unicode glyphs were heavily debated, and are as country-agnostic as possible now.</p>

      <p>Book of Changes (Yi Jing or I Ching) is a Chinese esoterical text written by several generations. The oldest part was written about 700{{_}}BC and describes a well-known method of cleromancy, divination using random numbers. One must random a hexagram and read its meaning.</p>

      <p>It is known that divination used a bundle of 50 sticks, traditionally stalks of yarrow, but it’s unknown how exactly. Methods with coin flipping appeared later, and modern divination using sticks is a reconstruction.</p>

      <p>Later Attic system was supplanted with [[ps:Grek|Ionian]] (Α=1, Β=2, …, Ι=10, Κ=20, …, Ρ=100, Σ=200…), but cultural interchange influenced Etruscans, and that led to Roman numerals.</p>

      <p>Phaistos Disc is an artifact of Crete-Minoan (proto-Greek) culture. Disc made of clay without a pottery wheel was found in 1908 in Crete, is 160{{_}}mm in diameter and 20{{_}}mm in thickness. Dated 2100–1100{{_}}BC and contains two inscriptions made in a spiral with unknown script using stamps. Exhibited in Heraklion Archaeological Museum (Crete).</p>
      <p />
      <p>The hypothesis that text is read from edge to center (right-to-left) is generally accepted. Many characters are mirrored for writing left-to-right: well, originally PEDESTRIAN walks to the right. Nobody knows whether it is Cretan script and what type it belongs to. Among unusual hypotheses: forgery done by the artist who worked at excavations, a list of the Cretan king’s territories, and a race game.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In 2002 Phaistos Disc was proposed to [[pt:private|ConScript Unicode Registry]] into E6D0–E6FF; the character order is the same (numbered by Arthur Evans, 1905). Withdrawn after inclusion of Phaistos Disc in actual Unicode. Two characters from Registry did{{_}}not{{_}}come into Unicode and taken from Latin: | and ¦. Character names are as given by Louis Godart (1995).</p>

      <p>''Epact'' word (Greek ἐπακτός) here means “borrowed”, not{{_}}equations for conversions from the solar calendar to lunar or for determining the date of Easter. Indeed, these numbers, descendants of normal [[ps:Copt|Coptic]] notation borrowed from [[ps:Grek|Greek]], were widely used in the Coptic-Arabic world 10th to 19th century, particularly in astronomy tables ≈1800. Written left-to-right.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Because of such non-standard use, these numbers are encoded as a separate block, not{{_}}as a{{_}}variant of Coptic.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In character samples you’ll see a gross difference with Unicode tables: ''Anshuman Pandey'', expert in ancient scripts, traced old ink symbols, and ''Google Noto'' project attempted to repeat them with lines of constant width.</p>

     <orig>
      <p>Znamenny chant (banner chant) or Kryuk chant (hook chant) is monophonic (the entire choir sings in unison) Orthodox chant. Named after ''banners''{{-}}musical signs accompanied with ''priznaks'' (marks). Initially, marks were written in red; Alexander Mezenets (17th century) invented a system of marks that does{{_}}not{{_}}need cinnabar. Unlike European notes that are encoded first of all to simplify programmers’ life and convey just rhythm in [[pt:plaintext|plain text]], Znamenny encoding is completely functional.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Banners convey a figure that is sung (up to 10 notes), and the pitch is specified with marks.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The earliest Znamenny scores are dated to 11th century. During the church reform (“schism”) of 17th century banners were replaced with Kievan notation (“axes”). Until 19th century it was gradually supplanted with polyphonic chant that’s present in churches nowadays. And Znamenny chant and monophony became a feature of Old Believers.</p>
      <p />
      <p>There are several types of chant: Kondak (type of church song), Stolp (pole), Put (way), and Demestvo (origin unclear, maybe from Latin ''domesticus''). The last one features elements of polyphony.</p>
      <p />
      <p>There are modern attempts to revive the Znamenny chant. Dvoyeznamenniki (double-banners), scores written with both banners and notes, gave the key to understanding Znamenny notation. It was brought to Unicode by the Ponomar project that draws fonts, builds Church Slavonic spelling and recognition dictionaries, and digitizes books.</p>

      <p>Notes looking like modern appeared in the 10th century. Those notes were square because they were drawn with a thick pen. Four lines per staff were drawn for singers, and more for instruments. There were no absolute frequencies. By the 13th century length marks were invented. Round notes appeared in an attempt to cursively draw a note with a pen of medium thickness. Even today special fountain pens for musicians are produced.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Notes evolved to their current form in the 17th century with equal temperament which made possible porting music to other instruments, playing in orchestras.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Music is [[pt:universality|non-text]] information and thus is outside scope of Unicode. But it’s tempting to use existing typography engines for storing notes and their parts in fonts to simplify music software, and shorten sheet PDFs. In this light the purpose of eight [[pt:format|format]] characters (beam, tie, slur, phrase) is unclear. In 2013 open standard SMuFL ''(Standard Music Font Layout)'' came, it extended the block to 2600 characters using [[pt:private|private-use]] codepoints.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Microtone notation initially accepted by Unicode (1D132 and 33) wasn’t widely used, few have seen these characters “in the wild”. Unicode{{_}}18 will add another notation (half-sharp, half-flat) widely used by musical software.</p>

      <p>Little is known about ancient Greeks. Initially they had five notes per octave, compensating such a shortage with various methods of instrument tuning, but later they got to halftones, sometimes even using quarter-tones. The main instruments were aulos (two pipes played simultaneously) and lyre.</p>
      <p />
      <p>There were different notations for musicians and singers, it allowed parallel writing of lyrics, music and hints for singers. Notes were written with letters, and characters that differ from normal Greek letters are gathered in this block without any system.</p>

      <p>Positional base-20 numerals invented in 1980s by Inuit (Eskimo) schoolchildren from town of Kaktovik, Alaska. Inuits count in twenties &lt;nobr&gt;(74 = 3×20 + 15 − 1)&lt;/nobr&gt;, and before the introduction of this system, they were among the worst in mathematics across all USA, after{{-}}a little above average, like bilingual people are often better in linguistics.</p>
      <p />
      <p>A base-20 abacus was designed. It looks like Japanese ''soroban'', but there are three “heavenly” beads. As in Japan, the bead is “off” if it’s near the edge, and “on” if near the middle wall. There are simple algorithms for conversion from base-20 to decimal.</p>
      <p />
      <p>There is no special character for fractional part (“vigesimal point”). Sometimes middle dot is used.</p>

      <p>Maya used a base-20 positional numeral system. Digits were written top-down. Sometimes face of the corresponding god was drawn instead of a digit. By common opinion, positional counting and zero were invented before Maya (maybe by Olmecs) before the common era. Shells, rods and dots tell that such numerals originate from counting boards.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Some sources state that in everyday life Maya used simpler non-positional numerals.</p>

      <p>Counting rods are an excellent tool for teaching counting to children. Old Chinese used a true positional system made of rods laid on a counting board, starting from the Warring States (5th century{{_}}BC) until the 16th century. There was a notation for fractions and even for negative numbers (with rods of another colour).</p>
      <p />
      <p>Vertical rods mean units, hundreds, tens of thousands…, horizontal{{-}}tens, thousands, hundreds of thousands… Sometimes vice-versa{{-}}in such a form the rods came into Unicode. Symbols of counting rods are sometimes written on paper.</p>
      <p />
      <p>If you need to count something and memorize the number, tally marks are used. European fives {{sm|𝍸}} are often associated with prison. Chinese use ideograph &lt;font size='+1'&gt;正&lt;/font&gt;. Foresters count in tens, both in America and in the former USSR (seen in a book by Ya.I.{{_}}Perelman), but this method did{{_}}not{{_}}enter Unicode.</p>

      <p>The gambling game májiàng (often named ''mahjong'' through Romanization) was invented late 19th century, the first surviving set dates to 1870. The game itself is little known to the Western world, but solitaire is widespread: remove identical tiles from the sides of the figure.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The solitaire was invented by student Brodie Lockard in 1981{{-}}he fell from a trampoline and was completely paralyzed. For the time of rehab, he convinced the CDC company to install a terminal, and he programmed on it holding a stick with teeth. The solitaire was a mixture of two Chinese games, mahjong and “demolish the turtle” played with dominoes. A terminal of the PLATO system was monochrome with 512×512 resolution{{-}}this was enough for such a complex game.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Mahjong suits come from one coin (rings), a bundle of 100 coins (bamboos) and {{n|10000}} coins (the ideograph below means ten thousand). Trumps are four winds, three dragons, four seasons and four flowers. Some variants contain other trumps{{-}}professions (fisherman, lumberjack, peasant, scholar) or arts (music, Go, calligraphy, drawing).</p>

      <p>In late 2022, mainland China attempted to fork Unicode by mapping 897 ideographs found in Chinese names to unallocated plane 0A. To prevent this, the ideographs were quickly vetted by experts, and 622 of them were identified as encodable.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Character repertoire is usually frozen long before the beta version. For example, black bird (crow/raven) was recoded from 1FABE to {{em|🐦}}+[[pt:zwj|ZWJ]]+{{em|⬛}}, and 1FABE became a hole. This time characters were frozen just a month before Unicode{{_}}15.1 was released.</p>
      <p />
      <p>All other ideographs were postponed for the sake of this urgent job. Only half a year left since fixing characters (August 2023) to the next beta (spring 2024), and Unicode{{_}}16 added no new ideographs.</p>

Since 1st century BC had a strong kingdom. In 461 was conquered by Persians, in 7th century submitted to Khazars for a short time and got liberty again. From 10th century part of Albania was Turkified and transformed into Shirvan (modern Azerbaijan) and Karabakh. Other regions took part in the ethnogenesis of Armenians, Georgians of Kakheti, Dagestanians. Possibly the alphabet was used up to 12th century by descendant languages. The country spans modern Russia and Georgia, and is thus conventionally classified as Europe.</p>

In 1886 a 16th century note in Armenian with Albanian script was found. In 1937 Soviet Armenologists found the full alphabet. In 1948 an early Christian temple of 6th century with authentic inscriptions was excavated when building a hydro power plant. In 1996 Sinai Palimpsest was found, the Bible written in Albanian, then erased and written in Georgian. It helped in decipherment, and the first one came in 2008.</p>

      <p>The alphabet is related to Zoroastrianism and its holy text Avesta. About 400 a special alphabet based on Book Pahlavi (script on Middle-Persian manuscripts) was created in Sasanid Persia to codify Avesta. By that time Zoroastrianism was many centuries old and language was little-understood, and prayers should be precisely repeated to be effective{{-}}so the alphabet was equipped with true vowels borrowed from neighbouring scripts.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Under Arabs Zoroastrians started to move to India, and since 12th century wrote in Avestan with local abugidas, traditionally [[ps:Gujr|Gujarati]]. The most famous of those Zoroastrians is Freddie Mercury (but his parents moved as far as to Zanzibar).</p>
      <p />
      <p>In 2000 ancient scripts were divided into five categories: A (in modern use{{-}}[[ps:Copt|Coptic]], [[ps:Runr|runes]]), B1 (studied [[pt:character|encodeable]]{{-}}[[ps:Xpeo|Persian cuneiform]]), B2 (studied unencodeable{{-}}[[ps:Egyp|Egyptian hierogyphs]]), C1 (non-systematic, requests from amateurs{{-}}[[ps:Xsux|Sumerian cuneiform]]), and C2 (unexplored, requests from amateurs{{-}}[[pk:101D0|Phaistos Dics]]). Avestan fell into the most important category A, and that gave it a chance for a place in [[pt:bmp|Basic Plane]]. But another opinion prevailed: encode Avestan and [[ps:Phlp|Pahlavi]] next to each other, in the supplementary plane. A hole was left for the unencoded Book Pahlavi.</p>

      <p>Consonants are initially voiceless, adding the same vowel makes it voiced: {{sm|ꚫ}} pa + {{sm|ꚠ}} a = ba. Vowel after syllable puts other vowel: {{sm|ꚫ}} pa + {{sm|ꚧ}} o = po.

      <p>Braille is a dot writing system for blind people. It uses groups 2×3{{_}}dots with binary encoding, sometimes the fourth row is added. Encoding differs even for British and American Braille. Has several “modes” (letters, numbers, highlight) “switched” with special characters.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Louis Braille, son of a leatherer, at the age of 3 was wounded with an awl and lost vision. Braille managed to enter Valentin Haüy’s school for the blind and used line-embossed type there. The other prototype for Braille is Charles Barbier’s “night writing”.

      <p>Buginese script, or Lontara is a descendant of [[ps:Brah|Brahmi]] via [[ps:Kawi|Kawi]], and works similarly. Since Dutch colonization is being supplanted with [[ps:Latn|Latin]]. “Lontara” name means a local palm tree whose leaves Buginese used for writing.</p>

      <p>Inherend vowel is {{t|a}}: {{sm|ᨀ}}=kа, {{sm|ᨀᨚ}}=kо. Initial vowels are appended to letter {{sm|ᨕ}}: {{sm|ᨕᨚ}}=o. [[pt:virama|Virama]] is absent: the most used consonant conjuncts are separate letters, the rest are not{{_}}written. This deficiency of Lontara is even used as a conundrum: read the pun correctly and find hidden meaning. Some specialists in old writing use virama.</p>

The demotic script was ideo-consonant, and writing in Egyptian with Greek letters (so-called Old Coptic) was regularly employed in 6th century BC, long before Alexander’s conquest of Egypt. The final transition from Demotic to Greek was done by Christians about 3rd century. The Coptic alphabet itself emerged when 6 or 7 letters (depending on dialect) were borrowed from Demotic script. The Sahidic dialect of Coptic (Upper Egypt) became literary in 4th century, in 11th it was replaced with Bohairic (Lower Egypt).</p>
      <p />
      <p>The word “Copt” is “Egypt” shortened under [[ps:Arab|Arabic]] influence. Its meaning shifted from all people of Egypt to Egyptian Christians. The language and script are still used by Copts as liturgical. Copts speak in Arabian, as a conversational language Coptic died in 17th to 19th century.</p>

      <p>Devanagari (literally ''from the city of the gods'') emerged from Brahmi script and became the alphabet for most Indian languages. A distinctive feature of Devanagari: letters hang from a horizontal line.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Consonant letters mean syllables with vowel {{t|a}} (in some languages and dialects {{t|ə}}). To display other syllables, vowel mark is needed: &lt;nobr&gt;ka {{sm|क}} + i {{sm| ि}} = ki {{sm|कि}}&lt;/nobr&gt;. To get a single consonant, [[pt:virama|virama]] (''stop'' or ''killer'') mark is added: k{{_}}{{sm|क्}}.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Viramas in Devanagari are rare, and mostly occur at the end of words because of [[pt:ligature|ligatures]]:</p>

      <p>Writing was mostly right-to-left, sometimes left-to-right or top-down. People and animals are always faced towards the beginning of a line. Encoded as left-to-right script, because scholars tend to mirror text for convenience.</p>

      <p>But we know hieroglyphs best of all, because they are preserved well carved in stone.

      <p>Glagolitic was invented about 863 by Byzantians Cyril and Methodius for a political mission{{-}}drive away Western priests from Moravia and establish an autonomous church to prevent from being conquered by Franks. Mission failed, Cyril died soon, Byzantians were driven away by the Western church, and fugitives from Moravia christianized Bulgaria and invented [[ps:Cyrl|Cyrillic]].</p>
      <p />
      <p>In 20th century it was finally proved that Glagolitic is older than Cyrillic: expensive parchment was often reused, and palimpsests (parchments with one text erased and other written) survived where Glagolitic was rewritten with Cyrillic. Linguistic arguments also exist. Nevertheless, Glagolitic co-existed with Cyrillic until 19th century and took letter forms from it, and that caused controversy. Possibly, the name ''Cyrillic'' initially meant Glagolitic script.</p>

      <p>Glagolitic seldom appeared in Rus, more often it was used in Bulgaria and Croatia. Bulgarian style is round, Croatian is square, and both are [[pt:unification|unified]].</p>

      <p>Greeks added vowels, and Greek is the first known true alphabet that encodes both consonants and vowels. Letter names didn’t change much, but lost all meaning: ''alef=ox''{{_}}→ ''alpha''.</p>

Educated people looked superciliiosly at Hangul, considering it women’s, children’s or vernacular script, hence name ''eonmun{{-}}vernacular script''. Later kings even banned Hangul. Growth of poetry and work of Western missionaries somewhat spread use of Hangul. Pro-Japanese government of late 19th century started to ban everything Chinese and introduce Hangul. After annexation of Korea by Japan (1910), Japanese was enforced, in those times “Hangul” name was coined, literally “great script”. In 1946, after liberation from Japan, new orthography was published. The only script of North Korea and the main in South.</p>

      <p>About 3rd century Japanese started to write with [[ps:Hani|Chinese ideographs]]. Auxiliary syllabary of Man’yōgana emerged from ideographs, pronunciation rather than image mattered. Hiragana is just an extremely cursive writing of Man’yōgana.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Women could{{_}}not{{_}}get education, they wrote with syllabary, and preferred smooth Hiragana to sloppy [[ps:Kana|Katakana]]. Nowadays Hiragana is used for words that do{{_}}not{{_}}have an{{_}}ideograph or it is unknown to writer/reader (except loanwords, they are written with Katakana), word endings, teaching children, pronunciation aids for ideographs.</p>

      <p>Hieroglyphs are named by place they were found ''(Anatolia = Asia Minor)'', or by language ''(Luwian)''. The name ''Hittite'' is incorrect, Hittite language was never written with those hieroglyphs, though first of them were invented in Hittite-Luwian bilingualism. In 12th and 11th century{{_}}BC there was Bronze Age Collapse with lack of materials, since 10th century they appear again. About 7th century{{_}}BC hieroglyphs were replaced with [[pt:alphabet|alphabetic]] script and forgotten.</p>
      <p />
      <p>About 500 hieroglyphs are known. Some hieroglyphs may mean not{{_}}just concept but syllable, but they are few.</p>
      <p />
      <p>About 1800 hieroglyphs drew scholars’ attention, it was hypothesized that they are Hittite. In 1915 Luwian language was finally deciphered via [[ps:Xsux|cuneiform]], in 1930s first decipherments of hieroglyphs started to appear. Finally deciphered in 1973.</p>

      <p>Shong Lue Yang, the inventor of the script, said that the script was given to him by God. The name “Pahawh” means “unite”. Development lasted from 1959 to 1971. Vietnam war was going on, Shong’s group was under suspicion by both communist and pro-American forces, and soon after script creation, Shong was assassinated by pro-Americans.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Most abugidas are “consonant-centric”. The central component of Pahawh is a vowel, and initial consonants are on the right of it. For example, the word “Hmong” {{sm|𖬌𖬣𖬵}} consists of vowel “oob”, consonant “qh” and a tack for tone.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Four stages exist, the last was proposed just a month before the assassination. Stages two and three are in use by different Hmong groups, and this block encodes all but the initial.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Hmongs from the same clan are perceived to be like brothers and sisters, and should not do anything looking like relationships, even spend time alone together. As Hmongs lost their homeland, clan signs might be worn as badges, or drawn on doors. These characters have never used widely.</p>

      <p>The script was invented in 1980s by Chervang Kong, priest of one of American Evangelist churches. The church did active missionary work, and script spread across USA.

      <p>Istvan{{_}}I, the first King of Hungary, united Hungarian tribes, turned to Christianity and switched to [[ps:Latn|Latin]] about 1000, but the use of runes continued, gradually declining. The last inscriptions are dated ≈1800.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Studying started in the 18th century, the main work was conducted about 1900, and even new runes were made for the remaining phonemes of Hungarian. Hungarians are proud of runes and even duplicate signs sometimes, but few can read them: in 2017 some pranksters replaced sign of Érd town with “Szia” (“hi”, both words are 3 runes long), and that was noticed in a month.</p>

Many vowel marks are ordinary [[pt:spacing|spacing]] characters for historical reasons.</p>

      <p>There are no spaces between words. Like in Thai, letters are [[pt:acrophonic|acrophonic]], that is named with suitable words: {{sm|ບ}} is “bo-be” or just “be” (goat). Letter {{sm|ຣ}} (r) became silent or turned to “L” and disappeared from orthography, remaining for foreign names only.</p>

      <p>Initial vowels do{{_}}not{{_}}have special shape, but are instead written with “null” consonant {{sm|ᤀ}} looking like Nepal flag. To get a syllable of three phonemes, first vowel mark is added, then final consonant: {{sm|ᤐᤳᤗᤥ}} {{t|pɔtlo}}. Underscore-like [[pt:virama|virama]] is used in loadwords for letters that do not have final form, and sometimes in syllables with long vowel {{sm|ᤁᤁ᤻}} {{t|kɔ:k}}.</p>

      <p>The script was used in islands of Cyprus and Cyclades. Most inscriptions are business-related and written on clay. Writings with ink on vessels and other objects also exist. But shape of signs suggests that the script was written with ink on leather or other soft material. About 1450{{_}}BC, with invasion of Greeks, it was supplanted with [[ps:Linb|Linear B]].</p>
      <p />
      <p>Arthur Evans found the script in late 19th century, and part of artifacts perished{{-}}some were thrown by untrained workmen, some were destroyed with rain at the warehouse. He called the script linear becuse it was made of lines, unlike earlier Cretan hieroglyphs (absent in Unicode). He delayed publication of discovery hoping to decipher on his own, until his death in 1941. There is no comprehensive decipherment{{-}}unlike later Linear B.</p>

      <p>Curly shape of characters suggests that they were written on leather or papyrus, furthermore Linear A was actually written with ink.

      <p>Spelling reforms are seldom embraced; everyday writing and film posters continued to use old orthography. Pre-Unicode fonts further spread new orthography.

      <p>All sources consider Multani script a Brahmic abugida, but in fact it degraded to [[pt:abjad|consonant]]: no vowel marks, vowels are written extremely selectively. Digits are [[pt:unification|unified]] with [[ps:Guru|Gurmukhi]]: there’s minor difference in 6 and 7.</p>

      <p>Runes have distinctive angular shape suitable for carving: wood resists differently along and across the grain, so it’s hard to make curves. Later variants of runes changed for cursive writing with quill. About {{n|5000}} runic inscriptions survive, with the oldest dating to the 2nd century.</p>

      <p>The block is a union of several runic alphabets:</p>

      <p>* Three runes for modern English attributed to J.{{_}}Tolkien</p>
      <p>* Five unique runes from Franks Casket, relic of the 8th century</p>
      <p />
      <p>Runes were gradually supplanted with [[ps:Latn|Latin]] following Christianization: by the 11th century in Western Europe, the 15th in Scandinavia, and lingering until the 20th century in some villages.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Nazi Germany liked esoterics, and runes together with it. Runes are popular in New Age and Neo-Paganism.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Scripts of arbitrary design are called “runes” in mass culture, even those unsuitable for carving. Alphabets of ancient [[ps:Orkh|Turks]], Bulgars and [[ps:Hung|Hungarians]] of similar angular shape are called runes too.</p>

      <p>It is not{{_}}stated whose side the gestures are written from, performer or spectator. Most publications are performer-oriented.

      <p />
      <p>Though the system isn’t strictly [[pt:universality|textual]]{{-}}position on page ''matters''{{-}}it was added to Unicode in 2015. Only characters were added, without any formatting.

      <p>Gestures with other hand, to other side, turned sideways are made with combining characters: any of Fill{{_}}2…6, and any of Rotation{{_}}2…16. For example, to write “gouge blinkers out”, {{sm|𝠎𝪟𝦆}}, one should write 1D80E+Fill6+1D986.</p>

      <p>Irish writer George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) was obsessed with shorthand, and worked on BBC’s Advisory Committee on Spoken English where he met several proponents of phonetic writing. So he willed to make a phonetic alphabet for English, far from [[ps:Latn|Latin]] to prevent from looking like pidgin English. The contest was won by Ronald Kingsley Read.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The alphabet consists of three types of letters: short, tall and deep. Short letters are vowels, vocalic ({{t|r}}, {{t|ℓ}}) and nasal consonants, tall are voiceless consonants. When turned 180°, tall letter becomes deep and starts to mean a corresponding voiced consonant (except pair {{t|ŋ}}{{t|h}}).</p>
      <p />
      <p>The first work that came in new alphabet was Shaw’s play ''Androcles and Lion'', in bilingual with English (1962). In 2013 the first non-bilingual came, ''Alice in Wonderland''. Anyway, publications in the new alphabet are sporadic.</p>

      <p>Invented by Krishna Bahadur Jentich (1926–1991). Initially a pure alphabet, it later adopted features from Brahmic scripts such as inherent {{t|a}}, [[pt:virama|virama]], a mark for final {{t|r}}, and even [[pt:ligature|ligatures]] for consonant conjuncts. The official orthography does not recognize these changes.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The script did not mark tones until recently, and tone marks are basic 0300, 0301 and 030D.</p>
      <p />
      <p>The main script is [[ps:Deva|Devanagari]], which poorly conveys Sunuwar phonetics. Also, there’s Tikamuli, an unencoded Brahmic abugida promoted by influential funds since 2005.</p>

      <p>By one of theories, the script came from [[ps:Kthi|Kaithi]] and was invented by Muslims. It was favoured by poets of 19th century for simplicity, but it had been supplanted with [[ps:Beng|Bengali]] until mid 20th century. In 2000s learning of Syloti Nagri resumed in Bangladesh.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Brahmic abugida with inherent vowel {{t|ɔ}} and [[pt:virama|virama]] ''(hasanta)'': {{sm|ꠇ}}=kɔ, {{sm|ꠇꠣ}}=ka, {{sm|ꠇ꠆}}=k. Other variant of virama exists, {{sm|ꠇ꠬}}=k, like in other Brahmic scripts. Initial vowels are separate letters. Text hangs from a headstroke, but unlike [[ps:Deva|Devanagari]], “holds” it tightly.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Virama in Syloti is infrequent for two reasons. First, double consonants and some conjuncts form ligatures: {{sm|ꠇ꠆ꠇ}}=kkɔ, {{sm|ꠇ꠆ꠔ}}=ktɔ. Such ligatures are typed in standard way: first letter, virama, second letter. Second, sometimes final {{t|ɔ}} becomes silent.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Written left to right, but Syloti books are bound right to left as a tribute to Islam. Digits are [[pt:unification|unified]] with Bengali.</p>

      <p>Script of [[ps:Mymr|Burmese]] origin. Tones weren’t written initially. After several reforms of 20th century (last in 1988) the script almost turned to alphabet, and it remains an abugida because of empty consonant {{sm|ᥟ}} if the word starts with vowel, and tone letters after final consonant of syllable (if it’s present).</p>

      <p>Spaces are written between sentences rather that words.</p>

      <p>In Tai Le of 3rd reform (1963–1988) usual European umlauts were used for tones: &lt;big&gt;à, á, ȧ, ä, ǎ&lt;/big&gt;.</p>

      <p>There are about {{n|500000}} Tai Nüa in China, but the language is being quickly supplanted with Chinese and thus is classified vulnarable. Less than {{n|500000}} more are scattered across other countries.</p>

      <p>The script came from [[ps:Brah|Brahmi]] via Pallava (old [[ps:Gran|Grantha]]). Inherent vowel is {{t|a}}. [[pt:virama|Virama]] is very frequent and turned to a dot.

Most consonant conjunct [[pt:ligature|ligatures]] consist of full initial letter and smaller subjoined.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Local digits are mostly used in Grantha texts, Tamils prefer ordinary 0…9. Unlike other Indic counting systems, there are special characters for 10, 100 and 1000. Before government of India adopted rupee sing ₹, Tamils had {{sm|௹}}.</p>

      <p>Tangut kingdom was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1227, but the script was used for several centuries more: the last specimen is 1502, also a handwritten mark later than 1680 exists.</p>

''Gabulhi Thaana'' (''incomplete script''), probably invented for Islamic quotes, started to supplant [[ps:Diak|Dives Akuru]] in the 17th century.

      <p>Very close ancient scripts ''Tulu'' and ''Tigalari'', some even consider them a single script. Maybe characters of sister-script ''Grantha-Malayalam'' will be added soon. They all are related to [[ps:Gran|Grantha]], and are rarely used nowadays in Hinduism. The first known inscription is 1159, but the script is much older. As a language of minority, Tulu was neglected by British authorities, and the script almost died.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Modern Tulu is written in [[ps:Knda|Kannada]] and [[ps:Mlym|Malayalam]], or in revived script commonly [[pt:unification|unified]] with Malayalam. There’s a consensus to not unify ancient and modern Tulu: live Brahmic scripts tend to simplify typing, and dead ones simplify font design and convey author’s spelling even on flawed fonts.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Ancient digits are very rarely attested and not encoded, modern ones are unified with Kannada. Tulu manuscripts contain editorial marks looking like subscript + (will probably be encoded later as a pan-Indic punctuation), so picture for virtual [[pt:virama|virama]] has plus inside rather than below. ''Danda'' bar is ordinary, and was encoded to prevent problems in multilingual text.</p>

      <p>Semites that inhabited Levant (modern Syria) could{{_}}not{{_}}boast of economic, cultural or military power, but instead were on an intersection of trade routes. So they borrowed principles of [[ps:Xsux|cuneiform]] for their needs creating an alphabet of 30 consonants written left to right; no one knows how it was made and what had been before. Names of many letters are reconstructions and unknown for sure. The only punctuation mark is word divider.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Many books and business documents survived, they gave understanding of different sides of Ugaritic life. There’s a suspicion that the alphabet is made by a single author because of economic design{{-}}frequent letters have less wedges.</p>
      <p />
      <p>It is believed that Ugaritic had no daughter scripts, though letter order is close to [[ps:Phnx|Phoenician]], and two unusual variants exist: shortened alphabet of 21 letter written right to left, and a tablet with [[ps:Sarb|South Arabic]] letter order.</p>

      <p>City of Ugarit was abandoned about 1200{{_}}BC with Bronze Age Collapse, total decline of arguable nature that happened in ancient world of that time.</p>

      <p>Script appeared about 1833. It was invented by Momolu Duwalu Bukele, probably under influence of [[ps:Cher|Cherokee]] (along with Africans several Native Americans migrated to Liberia, one even became a Vai chief).</p>

      <p>One of causes of Vai survival is good character set borrowed from African culture. The other is because it was used in trade with Dutch and Portuguese. In 1962 University of Liberia added characters for missing syllables.</p>

      <p>The principle of writing was taken from [[ps:Xsux|Sumero-Akkadian]] cuneiform, but letters are almost completely different. The most widespread version: the script was invented artificially to fix achievements of kings of Achaemenid dynasty. All known inscriptions cover just two centuries 520–330{{_}}BC.</p>
      <p />
      <p>By 1800 the word “king” had been identified. In 1802 Georg Grotefend deciphered kings’ names{{-}}he did{{_}}not{{_}}have a{{_}}bilingual, just knew Greek pronunciations like “Darius” or “Xerxes”, originally “Dārayavaʰuš” and “Xšaya-ṛšā”. In 1823 François Champollion found an [[ps:Egyp|Egyptian]]-cuneiform bilingual, and confirmed that Grotefend was right. In 1936 Eugène Burnouf guessed that one of inscriptions is a list of Daruis’ satrapies, and deciphered almost all alphabet. Decipherment of Persian cuneiform became a{{_}}key to Sumerian.</p>

      <p>Initially (≈3500{{_}}BC) business documents were written on clay (10 cows). Ideographs had appeared by 3200, and use of ideographs as syllables started by 3000{{_}}BC.

      <p />
      <p>Cuneiform was supplanted with more progressive scripts during 1st millennium{{_}}BC. For example, [[ps:Xpeo|Persian cuneiform]] (1st millennium{{_}}BC) was alphasyllabic rather that ideosyllabic. The last known specimen is 75{{_}}CE.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Tablets were preserved for several millennia in deserts of Persia and Iraq, and Persian cuneiform had been deciphered by mid 19th century. It became a key to Sumerian. All known languages had been deciphered by 1900.</p>

      <p>Yezidis are a part of the Kurdish people who profess the religion of Yezidism derived from [[ps:Avst|Zoroastrianism]].

      <p>Yezidis were constantly oppressed by Muslims, so their religion is mostly oral, few witnessed books in written form. Islamic State made a genocide of Yezidis in 2014–2017: about 5000 were killed, at least 5000 went missing, and about 500k fled from Iraq.

Moreover, it has two physical viramas, both are seen in sources and have no control meaning, one for the last letter in a word, the other for consonant conjuncts. There are two more ways to implement consonant conjuncts: using the third virtual virama (letters stack together, sometimes squishing in height), and using small signs of final consonants. These methods mix bizarrely: for example, one consonant with virama, and three stacked together. Initial vowels form by fixing vowel marks to {{sm|𑨀}}. None of sources has digits. Vertical writing is bizarre and outside the scope of Unicode: a mark that is initially above the second letter may appear above the entire word.</p>

      <p />
      <p>Despite obvious drawbacks, consonant script has some advantages.</p>
      <p>* In Semitic languages{{-}}[[ps:Phnx|Phoenician]], [[ps:Hebr|Hebrew]], Arabic{{-}}root is a skeleton of consonants, and vowels work as suffixes. For example, in Arabic ''jihad'' is done by ''mujahid''.</p>

      <p>* This script is shorter, that’s important when “paper” and “pens” are poor.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Many abjads have letters ''matres lectionis (mothers of reading)''{{-}}consonant letters meaning vowel phoneme. One of variants recorded in Hebrew: ''bayt'' → ''bet'' (house), and Yod letter was reinterpreted to words where diphtong never existed. Other variant is by articulation: [[ps:Grek|Greek]] letter Iota goes back to Phoenician letter Yod sometines meaning “i”. When vowel marks appeared, ''matres lectionis'' did{{_}}not{{_}}disappear, but started to complement them.</p>

      <p>Scholars disagree in definition of [[pt:abugida|abugida]]. But they are unanimous in one thing: '''group of scripts that came from [[ps:Brah|Brahmi]]''' are definitely abugidas.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In Semitic languages word’s root consists of consonants, and vowels are used for suffixes: ''Islam'' is practiced by ''Muslim'' in [[ps:Arab|Arabic]]. It was natural for them to introduce [[pt:abjad|consonant]] script. When [[ps:Armi|Aramaic]] script went eastwards and collided with Indo-European languages, syllabic script appeared that spread in some way across all South-East Asia except [[pt:cjk|China, Korea and Japan]].</p>
      <p />
      <p>Features of Brahmic abugidas:</p>
      <p>* Consonant letter means syllable with some inherent vowel, the rest are added with vowel marks: [[ps:Deva|Devanagari]] &lt;nobr&gt;ka {{sm|क}} + i {{sm| ि}} = ki {{sm|कि}}&lt;/nobr&gt;.</p>
      <p>* To get a lone consonant, [[pt:virama|virama]] sign is used: &lt;nobr&gt;ka {{sm|क}} + {{sm|्}} = k {{sm|क्}}&lt;/nobr&gt;.</p>
      <p>* Other diacritical marks: anusvara (nasal sound after consonant), candrabindu (the vowel is nasalized), nukta (borrowed phonemes; letter “k” in this word is borrowed and is written with nukta), visarga (phoneme {{t|h}} in Sanskrit).</p>
      <p>* Written left to right, unlike Semitic languages.</p>
      <p>* Alphabetical order is phonological: first vowels, then consonants from throat {{t|k}} to teeth {{t|s}}, and finally aspirate {{t|h}}.</p>
      <p>* Own [[pt:number|numerals]] are frequent, both actually used and [[pt:obsolete|obsolete]].</p>
      <p />
      <p>There are several methods to convey complex syllables:</p>
      <p>* Using virama (something like pa-n_-da): lone consonant is a separate syllable ([[ps:Tglg|Baybayin]]).</p>
      <p>* Using consonant conjunct (pa-nda): Devanagari {{sm|क्ष}} kša. It is typed as there is no ligature: ka+virama+ša{{-}}but in explicit form virama is present in the end of words only. Often in the end of words it’s also absent (inherent vowel becomes silent). Letter R often becomes small in these conjuncts. Small initial R ({{sm|र्क}} rka) is called ''repha'', small subjoined R ({{sm|क्र}} kra) is ''rakar''.</p>
      <p>* Using final consonant (pan-da){{-}}[[ps:Phag|Phags-Pa]]. No virama. Virtual virama or other means of making initial consonant conjuncts may exist.</p>
      <p>* Incomplete, badly conveying complex syllables (pa-da){{-}}[[ps:Bugi|Buginese]]. Some specimen degenerated to consonant scripts.</p>
      <p>* Lost inherent vowel (pa-nᵊ-da){{-}}through reform ([[ps:Laoo|Lao]]) or through natural evolution ([[ps:Guru|Gurmukhi]]). In the latter case it may not{{_}}always distinguish {{t|na}} and {{t|n}} and use virama in dictionaries.</p>

      <p />
      <p>1. Split text to independent lines.</p>
      <p />
      <p>2. Split every line into nested segments: the entire line is left-to-right, there are segments right-to-left inside it, they contain left-to-right segments, and so on. In iOS there was a bug: deep nesting of segments rebooted phone.</p>
      <p />
      <p>3. Isolate European numbers, give them direction left-to-right.</p>
      <p />
      <p>4. Give direction to the rest of characters. Reflect if they go right-to-left and are mirrored.</p>
      <p />
      <p>5. Execute higher-level protocols{{-}}for example, define direction of tables.</p>
      <p />
      <p>For example: “XX,YY 1.00&amp;lt;2.00 XX” = “ثث,حح 1.00&amp;lt;2.00 ثث”</p>

      <p>* If you write a Hebrew quotation in English text and the system formats it incorrectly, start the quotation with LRE/RLE, and finish with PDF.</p>
      <p>* You can use LRM, RLM and ALM for small bits of text. These are empty characters with strongly-specified direction, and this direction will be maintained until the system finds a character whose direction is known.</p>
      <p>* If you want to write from right to left in a left-to-right language or vice-versa, start the text with LRO/RLO, and finish with PDF. Avoid this notation, it’s a security issue.</p>

      <p>* Glyph substitution: when put to glyph A, mark B gets shape C. This is used for “squished” diacritics on capital letters, adjusting size of Indic vowel marks.</p>
      <p>* Anchor: binding point that is put manually.</p>
      <p>* And default anchor: the mark is put at positive or negative coordinates. When drawn relative to caret, it finds itself in the right place.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Unicode cannot cover several characters with one mark, but exploits some font mechanisms for this:</p>
      <p>* Some marks are placed halfway above character, and the other half hangs out, so they cover two characters: {{sm|a͡b}}.</p>
      <p>* The first character is covered with initial fragment, the second one etc with repeating one, and the last one with final fragment. This method is implemented badly in most fonts.</p>

      <p>In early 2025, principles for encoding [[ps:Egyp|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] were written.</p>
      <p />
      <p>* A hieroglyph can have plenty of forms: a man bowing down slightly or deeply, a snake with 2, 3 or more coils. These forms are encoded at scholars’ discretion.</p>
      <p>* Hieroglyphs are encoded in the most detailed form. Really fine details like armbands are omitted at scholars’ discretion.</p>
      <p>* Size and colour are not encoded.</p>
      <p>* If such fine details are truly important, Unicode is just not for you. Include the image.</p>
      <p>* Similar signs with different meanings are encoded separately. A circle might represent a tambourine, a ring, a pit…</p>
      <p>* If a hieroglyph can be constructed by mirroring, rotation and combining, it does not get a separate [[pt:codepoint|code point]].</p>
      <p>* But if such a form carries special meaning (leg+knife=injury), it will get.</p>
      <p>* Hieroglyphs are divided into three types: core, legacy and extended.</p>
      <p>* The hieroglyph is extended if it’s widely used in modern publications.</p>
      <p>* The hieroglyph is core if it’s verified with a reliable image (photo or trustworthy tracing). If it’s attested in hieratic texts, its hieroglyphic form must be easily reconstructable. If it’s encoded in several forms, some of the forms may be excluded from the core list.</p>
      <p>* Trivial forms and combinations from Unicode{{_}}5.2 are legacy. They have an equivalent sequence: how would they have been encoded today?</p>
      <p>* The rest of Unicode{{_}}5.2 (based on Gardiner’s list) is automatically core.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Unicode {{version}} contains:</p>
      <p>* core hieroglyphs: {{hcore}}</p>
      <p>* legacy: {{hlegacy}}</p>
      <p>* extended: {{hextended}}</p>

      <p />
      <p>People with invisible skin{{-}}{{em|🏂}} snowboarder{{-}}should also support gender and skintone modifiers, even if it will{{_}}not{{_}}change glyph.</p>

      <p>Plain text is a sequence of character codes, contrary to ''rich/formatted text'' that may contain visual elements like colours, fonts, hyperlinks. If those elements are stripped from rich text, everything remaining is plain text.</p>

      <p>Character and [[pt:combining|combining mark]] in one. For example, '''á''' is assembled from character and mark, and '''á''' is one precomposed character.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Three main reasons for creating precomposed characters: other entity, compatibility and beauty.</p>
      <p />
      <p>'''Other entity:''' Cyrillic Ё (''yo'') is not{{_}}Е (''ye'') with umlaut, so precomposed form exists. And Ю́ is just Ю (''yu'') with optional mark of accent, and there’s no{{_}}such precomposed character.</p>
      <p />
      <p>'''Compatibility:''' if limited typography engine cannot lay marks, or limited keyboard driver types characters one at a time, precomposed characters are the only option. Precomposed characters are often taken from existing encodings.</p>
      <p />
      <p>'''Beauty:''' mechanisms of laying marks are often imperfect, especially if designer did{{_}}not{{_}}foresee mark A on character B. And precomposed characters may become a warning for designer that ''this happens''.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In wider sense precomposed is a sequence of characters that may be displayed with styles, but it is encoded as a single character{{-}}for example, fraction &lt;big&gt;½&lt;/big&gt;.</p>

      <p>'''[[pt:normalization|Normalization]] of string will{{_}}not{{_}}change''' (4.1+). Version 3.1 had weaker guarantees: Unicode adopted more and more [[ps:Latn|Latin]] and other frequent scripts where normalization matters.</p>

      <p>'''Character’s properties may change, but not{{_}}so{{_}}much that its nature will change''' (1.1+). For example, capital letter will{{_}}not{{_}}turn to small, and [[pt:noncharacter|non-character]] will{{_}}not{{_}}return to use. In later versions of Unicode this rule was clarified.</p>

Unicode does{{_}}not{{_}}distinguish letter Y in English (“wye”), French (“i grec”) and German (“ypsilon”). Moreover, similar [[ps:Hani|ideographs]] in Chinese and Japanese are also unified.</p>
      <p />
      <p>There are several important exceptions:</p>
      <p>* Completely different entities: letter A from [[ps:Latn|Latin]], [[ps:Grek|Greek]], [[ps:Cyrl|Cyrillic]] and [[ps:Cher|Cherokee]] is{{_}}not the{{_}}same character.</p>
      <p>* Ease of processing: simple and non-break hyphen exists. Unicode has as many as three letters Ð with different small counterparts.</p>
      <p>* Ease of fontmaking: every South-Asian language has its own virtual [[pt:virama|virama]] (special character for constructing consonant conjuncts). The designer should read the standard and understand what virama does.</p>
      <p>* Historical reasons{{-}}for [[pt:convertibility|round-trip convertibility]]: Chinese ideographs from old encodings are always Chinese and do{{_}}not{{_}}have Japanese counterparts.</p>
      <p>* Ordinary overlook may also take place: angle brackets ⟨ mathematical and 〈 technical, the latter is [[pt:deprecated|deprecated]].</p>
      <p />
      <p>If the characters were unified, but then Unicode started to distinguish them, it’s disunification. For example, in 2005 [[ps:Grek|Greek]] and [[ps:Copt|Coptic]] were disunified.</p>

      <p>'''Unicode transformation format, 7 bit''' is a format of Unicode [[pt:serialization|serialization]] into a chain of printable [[pt:ascii|ASCII]] characters.</p>
      <p />
      <p>52 letters, 10 digits and '(),-./:? are just written. Sometimes other ASCII characters except ~\+ may be just written. Plus + may be encoded in +- (plus-hyphen). The rest characters are encoded to [[pt:utf16|UTF-16BE]], then into Base64 (62='''+''', 63='''/''') and enclosed with +…- characters (for example, &lt;nobr&gt;'''£1''' = +AKM-1&lt;/nobr&gt;).</p>
      <p />
      <p>If the code is followed with any character except Base64 characters and hyphen, the final hyphen may be omitted. If there is a single unencodeable characters between two encodeable, it may be encoded too to save bytes.</p>
      <p />
      <p>UTF-7 format does{{_}}not{{_}}have good properties of [[pt:utf8|UTF-8]] and even is ambiguous: the same text may be encoded in multiple ways.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Used only in E-mail as an alternative to more bulky ''quoted-printable''. In IMAP protocol special version of UTF-7 is used for mailbox names, where ampersand '''&amp;''' is instead of plus '''+''', 63=comma, final hyphen is always written, and among ASCII characters only &amp; is encoded. Such UTF-7 is unambiguous, that’s important for search. In World Wide Web UTF-7 is expressly forbidden: you can make an XSS attack if you trick the browser into thinking that the page is in UTF-7.</p>

      <p>'''Unicode transformation format, 8 bit''' is a format of Unicode [[pt:serialization|serialization]] into a chain of bytes. Invented in 1992 in Plan{{_}}9 operating system for compatibility with existing Internet software. Every [[pt:codepoint|code point]] is written with one of these sequences:</p>
      <p>* 0xxx.xxxx</p>
      <p>* 110x.xxxx{{_}}10xx.xxxx</p>
      <p>* 1110.xxxx{{_}}10xx.xxxx{{_}}10xx.xxxx</p>
      <p>* 1111.0xxx{{_}}10xx.xxxx{{_}}10xx.xxxx{{_}}10xx.xxxx</p>
      <p />
      <p>Properties of UTF-8:</p>
      <p>* Theoretically can write 2 billion code points with sequences up to 6 bytes. With limitations enforced to Unicode with [[pt:utf16|UTF-16]] there’s no sequences longer than 4.</p>
      <p>* Backwards compatibility: Latin text is indistinguishable from ASCII text. Bytes 00 and 7F are [[pt:control|control]], byte FF is impossible, that gives compatibility with program interfaces, terminal protocols.</p>
      <p>* Non-standard format of UTF-8 exists where null character is encoded as C0{{_}}80, distinguishing it from end of string 00.</p>
      <p>* Self-synchronizing: if you add any erroneous bytes, the rest text remains readable. Search in correct UTF-8 with legacy program also won’t make false positives.</p>
      <p>* Reliable detection: meaningful text in single-byte encoding (unless it is pure ASCII) or UTF-16 is impossible to confuse with UTF-8.</p>
      <p>* Monotonous: sorting by UTF-8 bytes is the same as sorting by character codes.</p>
      <p />
      <p>UTF-8 is widely used as a format of inter-software exchange, including most Internet formats and protocols. [[pt:bom|Byte order mark]] is EF{{_}}BB{{_}}BF. As a format of program interface UTF-8 is used in Linux, cross-platform libraries like SSL.</p>

      <p>'''Unicode tranformation format, 16 bit''' is a format of Unicode [[pt:serialization|serialization]] into a chain of two-byte machine words.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Unicode was initially thought as two-byte encoding, and writing of text with two-byte characters was named UCS-2. Progressive languages and libraries of those times like Java and Windows{{_}}NT quickly adopted two-byte character, that simplified text processing. But soon it became clear that two bytes are{{_}}not{{_}}enough, and in 1996 encoding with variable number of two-byte words was made as a compromise, and it was named UTF-16.</p>
      <p>* Characters 0…D7FF and E000…FFFF are just written;</p>
      <p>* Characters D800…DFFF are forbidden;</p>
      <p>* Characters 10000 and greater are written as '''surrogate pair''':</p>
      <p>: 1101.10yy.yyyy.yyyy{{_}}1101.11yy.yyyy.yyyy, where y=x−10000₁₆.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Properties of UTF-16:</p>
      <p>* Imposes a limitation to Unicode capacity: 2&lt;big&gt;²⁰&lt;/big&gt;+2&lt;big&gt;¹⁶&lt;/big&gt;−2&lt;big&gt;¹¹&lt;/big&gt;={{n|1112064}} characters.</p>
      <p>* Backwards compatibility: text of [[pt:bmp|Basic Plane]] is indistinguishable from UCS-2. If the working language lays in Basic Plane and characters of other planes are{{_}}not{{_}}processed (left intact or deleted), two-byte character is suitable for text processing.</p>
      <p>* Self-synchronizing: if you add any erroneous '''words''' (not bytes), the rest text remains readable. Search in UTF-16, even of one character, will{{_}}not{{_}}make false positives.</p>
      <p>* Unreliable detection: without [[pt:bom|byte order mark]] UTF-16 format and byte order are detectable only on indirect evidence{{-}}by statistics or surrogate pairs if they are present. Well-known [[pt:ascii|ASCII]] string “Bush hid the facts” breaks Windows’ statistical detection of UCS-2.</p>
      <p>* Non-monotonous: sorting by UTF-16 words is different from sorting by character codes.</p>
      <p />
      <p>As a format of inter-software exchange UTF-16 is mainly used in binary files originating from Windows and Mac/Motorola (for example, in TrueType fonts). These files do{{_}}not{{_}}need byte order mark; in text files it is FE{{_}}FF for UTF-16BE и FF{{_}}FE for UTF-16LE. As a format of program interface it’s used in Windows, Java, JavaScript, Qt.</p>

      <p>'''Unicode transformation format, 32 bit''' aka '''UCS-4''' is a format of Unicode [[pt:serialization|serialization]] into a chain of four-byte machine words. Characters codes are just written one after another.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Properties of UTF-32:</p>
      <p>* Constant-length encoding. That’s why it is the most suitable for compex text processing.</p>
      <p>* Extremely bulky: in [[pt:utf8|UTF-8]] and [[pt:utf16|UTF-16]] maximum character size is 4 bytes, and in UTF-32 all character are four-byte.</p>
      <p>* Detected reliably by eleven most significant bits, they are always zeros.</p>
      <p />
      <p>As a format of inter-software exchange UTF-32 is almost never used because of bulkiness. If you need{{-}}[[pt:bom|byte order mark]] is 00{{_}}00{{_}}FE{{_}}FF for UTF-32BE and FF{{_}}FE{{_}}00{{_}}00 for UTF-32LE.

      <p>Virama (Sanskrit “stop”) is a sign in [[pt:brahmic|Brahmic]] abugidas meaning “erase inherent vowel”. For example, in [[ps:Deva|Devanagari]]: &lt;nobr&gt;ka {{sm|क}} + {{sm|्}} = k {{sm|क्}}&lt;/nobr&gt;.</p>
      <p />
      <p>In reality in Indian languages its name is ''halant (Hindi “killer”), halanta, hošonto, chandrakkala ([[ps:Mlym|Malayalam]] “moon”).</p>
      <p />
      <p>Some languages do{{_}}not{{_}}use virama often. For example:</p>
      <p>* [[pt:ligature|ligatures]] for consonant conjuncts{{-}}Devanagari {{sm|क्ष}} кša. They are written and encoded as if there’s no ligature, ka+virama+ša. To tear a ligature and input two letters and virama, one should type ka+virama+ZWNJ+ša;</p>
      <p>* sings for final consonant{{-}}[[ps:Cham|Cham]], [[ps:Limb|Limbu]];</p>
      <p>* inherent vowel reduced to nothing{{-}}[[ps:Guru|Punjabi]]. Many languages of India, including Hindi, omit virama in the end of words;</p>
      <p>* spelling reform dropped inherent vowel{{-}}[[ps:Laoo|Lao]];</p>
      <p>* virama may be a single entity with letter{{-}}[[ps:Talu|New Tai Lue]];</p>
      <p>* unable to write “extra” consonants{{-}}[[ps:Bugi|Buginese]].</p>
      <p />
      <p>Most viramas are [[pt:combining|combining marks]]. But some are [[pt:spacing|spacing]] ([[ps:Java|Javanese]]).</p>
      <p />
      <p>Some scripts ([[ps:Khar|Kharoshthi]], [[ps:Mtei|Meitei Mayek]]) feature “virtual virama” for assembling ligatures. Sometimes even ([[ps:Sund|Sundanese]], [[ps:Cakm|Chakma]]) together with visible virama. Virtual virama looks like a cross, but leaving it visible in ordinary text is a mistake.</p>
