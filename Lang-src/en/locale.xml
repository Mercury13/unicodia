	 eng-terms: what to do with English terms hardcoded into program
		0: use L10n only (for English)
		1: show some
		2: show ALL terms and use them as a sorting key
			(as a workaround for complex languages like Japanese)
	 trigger-stamp: some NUMBER (as you see, date-based), NEVER CHANGES
		(may increase if someone checks blatant auto-translation)
		For example, we are Spanish in US, and are forced to use English.
		What we save: language — English, stamp — greatest of all present langs
		When Spanish finally arrives, its trigger-stamp will be greater,
			and the program will switch to Spanish automatically.
		When the user says, “No, I want English,” max stamp will be new,
			and auto-switch no more happens.
