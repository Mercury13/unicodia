# Rationale behind block icons

* egg = easter egg
* IDK = I don’t know
* JSI = just something interesting
* lo-res = whatever I could draw in low resolution
* TMB = the most basic
* LR = LastResort

## International

* Alchemical: egg, water-alcohol mixture
* Alphabetic presentation forms: JSI from Latin
* Arrows: TMB
* Arrows supp A: JSI
* Arrows supp B: JSI
* Arrows supp C: JSI, made when there was Wingdings only + alignment to pixel grid
* Block elements: JSI, drawn programmatically
* Box drawing: JSI, wanted to use up the entire height
* Braille: JSI
* Chess: JSI, black is more distinguishable
* Combining diacr: some common umlaut
* Combining diacr supp: JSI
* Combining diacr ex: JSI
* Combining diacr for symbols: JSI
* Combining half marks: a complex composition with the most basic pair. Drawing two characters is a cool winning
* Control pictures: the most used control picture. LR drew a “general image” CTL, but it’s clearly worse
* Counting rods: egg, prison counting. LR (horizontal 3) is clearly worse
* Currency: the most used currency ever (after ASCII $)
* Dingbats: something nice, needed to simplify for 16×16. LR took a plane but 1) Unicodia groups blocks, and leaves and flowers in both are better somehow 2) Fleuron is heither shape nor emoji
* Orna dingbats: same, with something pointing right-up, purportedly the best for us writing →
* Domino: lo-res
* Emoticons: one of the most common emoji
* Enclosing alnum: TMB ①
* Enclosing alnum supp: the simplest broadcasting mark
* Geom shapes: someday was hand-aligned to pixels in GIMP
* Shapes ex: JSI
* IPA: a known char from English transcription
* Letterlike: something well-known. LR’s ™ is even better known but does not fit into square
* Mahjong: lo-res
* Math op: some well-known, even more than ∀ (by coincidence, LR too)
* Math op supp: some strange integral (by coincidence, LR took other integral)
* Math sym misc A: what to take?
* Math sym misc B: IDK, box-and whiskers are the nicest?
* Math alph: JSI, bold and handwritten
* Modifier tone: JSI
* Music: TMB note
* Number forms: TMB (the block was completed with ⅐ etc in 5.2)
* OCR: TMB
* Phonetic ex: JSI
* Phonetic ex supp: JSI
* Playing cards: TMB + lo-res, hearts are better than spades. LR’s back is surely worse
* Punctuation: TMB, but not some funky quote. There’s a real argument who’s better, LR or me
* Punc supp: same, coincidence with LR
* Spacing modifiers: TMB but not superscript. LR is surely worse
* Super/subscripts: egg, The Answer
* Sutton: lo-res + JSI + egg, rocker horns
* Legacy: JSI; as resolution is 16×16, found Apple II’s 7×8 pair
* Legacy ex: same, wanted in unison with Apple’s on HiDPI
* Symbols misc: JSI, lo-res
* Symbols and arrows misc: JSI influenced with lo-res
* Symbols and pictographs misc: story of water pistol
* Symbols and pictographs supp: JSI, lo-res
* Symbols and pictographs ex A: same
* Tech misc: the most techy character
* Transport: TMB + lo-res

## Technical
* Specials: the only non-format, LR took the same (not a coincidence)
* Tags: what’s remaining? Tag T is used on higher resolution
* Variation selectors: just a general image, what’s remaining?

## Europe
* Albanian all: TMB
* Ancient: TMB but not trivial. LR’s is more trivial (some sort of star or barred X)
* Byzantine music: JSI big but lo-res
* Caucasian: TMB
* Cprt: JSI
* Cpmn: JSI
* Cyrl: the main purely Cyrillic letter
* Cyrl supp: egg, letter for “peace death” piece of Russian mat
* Cyrl ex A: JSI, not tall
* Cyrl ex B: JSI
* Cyrl ex C: the most distinct letter
* Cyrl ex D: JSI, all are modifiers
* Dupl: JSI (most “letters” are just lines), did not want arrow
* Shorthand format: lo-res
* Geor: found a letter that’s somehow OK in all three scripts (Mkhedruli > Asomtavruli)
* Glag: LR+egg (Glagoli)
* Glag supp: TMB, lo-res
* Goth: TMB
* Greek: JSI, lowercase is better. I was trained as a mathematician and wrote that ξ multiple times
* Greek ex: LR, and while working, decided to exaggerate apostrophe/iota
* Greek num: JSI, coincidence with LR
* Greek music: TMB + egg, Warhammer 40k
* Hung: JSI. And LR somehow drew a character absent in Unicode table
* Ital: TMB
* Latn: some letter distinct for Latn, word “Latin”. LR’s A is surely a bad choice
* Latin-1: wanted umlaut (two dots)
* Latn ex add: JSI
* Latn ex all: JSI
* LinA, LinB: JSI
* Aegean: lo-res (drawn semi-programmatically)
* Ogam: JSI, full cell, coincided with LR
* Perm: TMB, in harmony with LR
* Phaistos disc: TMB + lo-res (I’ll never draw LR’s pedestrian)
* Runr: TMB, in harmony with LR
* Shaw: JSI (most letters are basic shapes)
* Znamenny: TMB, in harmony with LR

## Asia RtL
* Common: A. Simple line → smth else
* Khar: TMB K
* Orkh: JSI
* Phlp: interesting punctuation
* Syrc: this style of Syriac has a really bad aleph

## Asia LtR
* Common Indic: fill the entire cell
* Armn: JSI
* Cari, Lyci: both are too close to Greek, what to take?
* Hluw: JSI, lo-res
* Plrd: JSI
* Xpeo: just some interesting wedge combination
* Xsux: JSI, star is from textbooks, and should never be simpler than Ugar/Xpeo
* Ugar: wedges form a nice shape, emphasizes simplicity

## Brahmic
* Common Brahmic: TMB K, in harmony with LR
* Brah: JSI, K = simple cross
* Cakm: K too basic (even LR averted!)
* Cham: same, conveys how most letters look
* Lana: K is too basic, and in some fonts confusion with Mymr
* Laoo: maybe K too basic?
* Limb: Nepali flag :) Most icons were made before the war (in PNG), so this character was just more interesting than Z-shaped K
* Mtei: P is more interesting
* Mymr A: nice cat-like ligature
* Phag: K is too basic
* Soyo, Zanb: LR is somehow took vowel-carrier w/o point
* Talu: K but better with that affixed virama
* Tibt: IDK, early icon, maybe K will look good
* Thai: K too basic

## CJK
* Bopo: IDK
* CJK compat: TMB
* CJK compat forms: JSI
* CJK strokes: JSI
* CJK symbols: JSI
* Hani all: JSI + lo-res
* Enclosed CJK: January would be better than parenthesized Hang
* Enclosed ideo: lo-res
* Halfwidth: whatever fullwidth looks better
* Hang jamo: the nicest jamo in sans-serif
* Hang compat jamo: JSI on lo-res
* Hang jamo ex A: to convey the meaning of “extended”
* Hang jamo ex B: JSI, better among medial
* Hang syllables: TMB with few hintable lines, but more complex than all jamo
* Hira, Kana, Kana phon: requested by a real Japanese, I considered refuse but they sat well
* kana supp, kana ex a: lo-res
* kana ex B: JSI (all chars are very basic)
* kana small: TMB as of 12.0 + small Ko (15.0) does not look so good
* Nshu: JSI
* Small forms vars: the 1st looking like a small form
* Tai Xuan: all three types of lines + some meaning found before our war (strength)
* Tang all: JSI, historical
* Vertical forms: distinct char
* Yijing: some meaning related to our war (deliverance)

## Ocean
* Bali, Java: want parallel, want descenders, and K is too dazzling
* Batk: JSI, no letter K
* Bugi: K is really basic, the next is G
* Diak: K is too ornate
* Kawi: TMB K
* Maka: wanted bird theme
* Rjng: TMB K, under the influence of LR
* Sinh: TMB K
* Sinh numbers: TMB 1
* Sund: IDK
* Sund supp: the only balanced sign among 8 (no letters, signs only)
* Tglg, Hano, Buhd, Tagb: the same letter for four scripts, dislike K as it’s two lines in Buhd and cross in Tagb
* Thaa: JSI

## Africa
* All are JSI, I just wanted to convey the spirit of script
* Egyp: real lo-res (need head only) + both LR’s blocks are just men, what’s the difference?
* Egyp format: mine is better because I took an image specific for Egyp
* Ethi: egg, the first letter in “abugida”
* Gara: LR probably thought less than I and took a vowel-carrier w/o point. The ideal icon is G (H-like) with hook, and I’ll 

## America
* Cans all: somehow decided with an umlaut
* Cans ex A: TMB
* Cher: looks like Latin, and I wanted a “Latin-but-not-really” letter. My version is more suitable for lo-res than LR
* Cher supp: same but small
* Dsrt: JSI (what a coincidence, LR took the same)
* Kaktovik: egg 13
* Mayan: egg 13
* NP Hmong: JSI
* Osge: JSI w/o ascenders/descenders, “Latin-but-not-really”. LR made a real fluke: there’s Lisu ex with one character, and they decided to take it
