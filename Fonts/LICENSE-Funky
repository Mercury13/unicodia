Matrix for modifier chars is: W×65%, H×60% starting from char origin, and Y+407; old chars Y+120.
Matrix for subscript chars is: W×65%, H×60% starting from char origin, and Y−96.


=== Toto • unknown origin ===

Probably someone from SIL International, SIL Open Font License
Status: probably fully working, I tried to copy all tables


=== Gothic • Junicode ===

Status: diaeresis works, numbers do not
Matrix is ×135%


=== Coptic • NewAthena  ===

Status: at least as functional as Noto and NewAthena combined!


== Status of MY scripts ==

=== Cypro-Minoan ===

Source of inspiration: Michael Everson’s Unicode tracings
Status: should work

=== Garay ===

Source of glyphs: some poor Latin-mapped font
Status: barely working, either improve or hand to other font

=== Makasar ===

Source of inspiration: Makasar prince’s diaries, Anshuman Pandey’s font
Status: working, just Arabic-Indic digits are absent

Rationale:
* Drawn like in Pandey’s font, sometimes more streamlined.
* As this font is not of print quality, I decided to use rounded ends everywhere

=== Nag Mundari ===

Source of inspiration: educational Nag specimen
Status: working

=== Ol Onal ===

Source of inspiration: alphabet written with marker + multilingual writings on idol
Status: working, minor glyph problems, no danda

Rationale:
1. Backslash quill is common in all Indic scripts, Brahmic and alphabetical. I played with it in e.g. Q-like letter (DB Aw).
2. Inverse contrast is also common. As Ol Onal is a really small script, it’s routinely repeated in e.g. Devanagari that’s more compact (IDK whether Devanagari is Bhumij or other local language). They mechanically compress fonts and get… you get point.
3. I draw Noto’s drop everywhere curved thick line starts rather than ends. Just draw the letter with quill dipped into ink, or a really poor ballpoint — there were in 90s, I did not see such very-very long, and ≈2000 I wrote lectures with a rather good pen. (There were LOTS of bad copybooks, but that’s another thing.)
4. As Ol Onal is a script w/o printed tradition, I was inspired with handwritten specimen. This approach proved good in Todhri, and I was probably right, SIL did the same with Kirat.
5. I wanted to make glottal-8 smaller than normal letter, and I checked whether it’s possible.
6. Position of umlauts in printed text is strange because of poor fontmaker’s skills and ASCII mapping. Handwritten text often draws them in more natural places.


=== Todhri ===

Source of inspiration: Michael Everson’s font, Johann von Hahn’s description, handwritten notes from Unicode request
Status: working, no kerning because of doubtful R

Rationale:
* B: both closed and diverging letters are attested, and quick writing makes ends diverge. So I drew something in between.
* R: drawn by printed sources, really doubtful
* RR: the only handwritten specimen known to me is a mixture of Greek Rho and Latin P
* T/C: somewhere in between printed and handwritten


== Stability policy ==

WILL STAY:
* Working scripts of decent quality made by me: Makasar, Cypro-Minoan, Nag, Todhri
* ASCII and other auxiliary characters
* All of them MAY change style/metrics

WILL PROBABLY DISAPPEAR when better font arrives:
* Scripts made by others
* Super/subscripts: while Unicodia’s main font is Cambria, won’t

WILL SURELY DISAPPEAR:
* Lone characters made to gag tofu
* All non-functional scripts, both mine and others’
* All craggy scripts, both mine and others’

ALREADY DISAPPEARED and handing to other fonts
* Ottoman Siyaq numbers → use Noto Ottoman Siyaq
* Devanagari Jain symbols → use Noto Devanagari
