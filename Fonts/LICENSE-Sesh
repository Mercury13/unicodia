JSesh Fonts Licenses

Most of the glyphs included in JSesh have been created by Serge Jean Paul THOMAS.

According to his instructions:

• it is allowed to distribute the fonts with JSesh;
• it is allowed to use the fonts when JSesh is used as a library for other softwares;
• it is allowed to use JSesh fonts for publications (paper, databases, web sites);
• it is allowed to modify the signs and use them under the same terms.

M. Thomas doesn’t want the font to be used for other hieroglyphic word processors.

Please note that this can’t be changed. I am aware that this might be a bit inconvenient for some projects.

The few signs drawn by Serge ROSMORDUC are distributed according to the SIL OPENFONT LICENSE. In some cases, the information is available in the SVG file itself.
