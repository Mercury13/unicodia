# How to develop?
* Toolkit can probably run on W7, but Qt Creator, main development environment, absolutely needs W10
* Download/find all tools for building.
* Ensure that your Qt has MinGW 11+. Or make a custom kit of some MinGW Qt and MSYS compiler; tested Qt 6.1.3, 6.7.0. I actually use 6.1.3 as the last supporting W7 and fast enough on W10.
* Compile and run AutoBuilder.
* Move UcAuto.cpp to Unicodia/Uc.
* Compile Unicodia.
* Then you need to recreate working directory, symlinking all files/folders existing in original Unicodia.
* Congratulations! You can now run Unicodia directly from Qt Creator!

# Hidden commands
* F12 — reload translation from disk. Locale does NOT reload
* Ctrl+F12 — dump Library tile info to opt.xml, for access optimization. After placing it into NotoEmoji and running tape.bat the first chunk of emoji.zip will contains all emoji needed for tiles
* Ctrl+Shift+H — highlight all chars served by that font, to check font dispatching/correctness
* Ctrl+Shift+L — test font dispatching
* Ctrl+Shift+Q — test emoji repainting engine
* Ctrl+Shift+T — tofu stats
* Ctrl+Shift+W — debug algorithms of sorting blocks

# Update font: what to pay attention to?
* First of all tofu stats (About → Tofu statistics / Ctrl+Shift+T): there should be no new tofu
* Then display of characters and samples
* If some character hangs → check whether it was fixed professionally. Most hanging characters are done in UnicodiaFunky font, some in *Fixup.
* Check license what was done by author of Unicodia, and whether we need it now.

# How to update emoji?
* Simple emoji (no skintones)
  * Ensure that it has no &lt;clipPath&gt;, edit if needed.
    * ``Originals`` is directory for original SVGs, ``Remakes`` is for remade but unoptimized
  * If emoji-related library data changed → copy opt.xml from AutoBuilder to NotoEmoji
  * Make sure **Unicodia is closed**, run tape.bat. It’ll automatically run SVG cleaner from Program Files (x86).
* Two or more skintones (e.g. interracial kiss/handshake): same. They are repainted sometimes, but not checked.
  * Algorithm 1 is for interracial handshakes (few colours, easy, tedious), algorithm 2 is for wrestlers/Playboy bunnies (harder but quicker to do), they won’t be described here.
* One skintone (one person, same-race handshake…), repainted versions are stored
  * Same technical requirement: no clipPath’s
  * Just store them.  
  * After that press Ctrl+Shift+Q in Unicodia.
  * Copy resulting BMP files to AutoQa\SkinToneQa. You can do it manually, or using “Good” button in QaCompareBmp tool.
* One skintone, repainted versions are created on-the-fly (e.g. because of &lt;clipPath&gt;)
  * So-called “preparation”: we need to remember what was originally
    * First copy ORIGINAL files with all skintones to NotoEmoji
	* It’s better to run SvgCleaner
    * Make sure Unicodia is closed, run tape.bat
    * Press Ctrl+Shift+Q in Unicodia.
    * Copy resulting BMP files to AutoQa\SkinToneQa. You can do it manually, or using “Good” button in QaCompareBmp tool.
  * Then normal work commences.
    * It’s absolutely needed to change **nose colour** E59600 → E49600, to prevent confusion with ears
    * Remove original files, copy your remake.
    * Make sure Unicodia is closed, run tape.bat
    * Press Ctrl+Shift+Q in Unicodia.
    * Check what’s different using QaCompareBmp. If some colour is repainted erroneously (teacher/blackboard, fireman/insignia) → change colour a bit and repeat
    * If you are satisfied with difference → press “Good” button in QaCompareBmp.

# How to update to next Unicode
## Adapting to new Unicode data
* Go to ``MiscFiles/RawData``, modify ``load.bat`` and load bases of the next Unicode
* Make ``AutoBuilder`` run (who knows what will be added to the next bases)
  * Warning, while Unicode is alpha/beta, AutoBuilder may contain manual patches: see bug #349
* Run it
* Copy all ``UcAuto*`` to ``Unicodia/Uc``
* Make Unicodia compile, first of all manually update version/script/block data:
  * VERSIONS: add new Unicode and emoji versions (``EcVersion``). Write when it’s going to be released. If it’s beta, add ``Vfg::BETA`` flag
  * BLOCKS: they are in ``UcBlocks.cpp``. While the block is full of tofu, add ``Ifg::MISSING`` flag to synthIcon field
  * SCRIPTS: they are in ``UcScripts.cpp``. **Do not mess up alphabetic order!**
* Now Unicodia runs somehow!!

## Urgent first-party data: don’t release until you fill all somehow
* Block extension history:
  * Add the new version to ``BlockExtensionHistory``
  * Run it, check if the block was extended/shrunk
  * Write that to ``UcBlocks.cpp``
    * Sample: during U2…16 three blocks were extended (Tibt, Ahom, Egyp format) and one shrunk (Tang supp)
  * As an alternative, you may check what changed in the **newest** ``Blocks.txt``, as older data is already written
* Texts
  * Run UTranslator, open ``en.uorig``
  * For example, you decided to add Klingon script:
    * Go to ``Script`` folder, press _Original → Add group_. Ensure that folder is in ``Script``
    * Name it ``Klin``
    * Better move the group into its alphabetic place using commands _Original → Move up/Move down_
    * Press _Original → Add text_. Ensure that text is in ``Klin``
    * Name it ``Name``, write _Klingon_
    * Also add ``Lang`` and ``Text`` texts
  * If you know languages, translate to Russian/Ukrainian using the same UTranslator
    * File → Update data, Go → Find warnings → All, and close those changes
  * If some blocks should be logically near, but specific language makes a mess (Greek → Ancient Greek numbers), add an ellipsis to the beginning using ``locale.xml``.
    * This ellipsis will automatically go if you sort blocks by code
* Decapitalization rules: “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A” → “Latin capital letter A”
  * They are in ``AutoBuilder/data.cpp``
  * See _Decapitalization rules_ below
  * Of course, run AutoBuilder
  * Always compare before and after with some diff tool! Heal one thing and hurt another — that’s frequent!
  * Copy CPP files again
* Block icons
  * There are two ways to make a block icon, SVG and programmatic. I’ll talk about the former, default
  * 16×16 px, scale 1, no background, foreground is arbitrary. Put them to ``Resources/Scripts``, optimize somehow, write a new filename to ``scripts.qrc``
    * **All new icons** will have foreground colour #c01c28 (=Gnome HIG red 4). This colour is automatically repainted to block-specific. Raise flag Ifg::PAINT_SVG to enable this feature. Of course, you may use any colour you want, but better use placeholder unless there’s a good reason.
	* Very rare (one custom icon only), but: background colour is #f9f06b (=Gnome HIG yellow 1).
    * What to draw if the block is still full of tofu? In U14/15 I drew “U ↵ 14”, in U16/17 I drew very crude images of characters.
  * Go to UcBlocks.cpp. Write in ``synthIcon`` field what characters (up to two) you drew and how to align that picture to pixels on HiDPI
    * Example 1: Devanagari 0900 has upper line at 2px and vertical stem at 9px — thus coordinates of cardinal stem are (9, 2)
    * Example 2: Basic Latin 0000 has vertical stem at 5px and horizontal line at 15px, but to make it aligned to pixels, I greatly shifted to the right — I think that imbalance is 0.3px to the right.
    * Example 3: Kawi 11F00 has almost square letter with 2px frame — decided to make a custom engine that deflates rectangle a bit, aligning all three sides to pixels
    * Example 4: Tangut 17000 has historical icon and modern font — thus use Ifg::HISTORICAL
    * Do not forget Ifg::MISSING if the block is full of tofu.

## Icon policy
* There are several approaches to icons: spirit, evolution, peculiar character, Easter egg
* Greek-type scripts (Cari, Cher, Copt, Cyrl, Goth, Grek, Latn, Lyci, Lydi, Perm): the main approach is peculiar character
  * If it has some meaning → cool (Latin L for Latin, Cyrillic Я is the last letter)
  * Evolutionary approach is sometimes OK (Coptic A)
* For sister-scripts the best approach is evolution, e.g. find some letter that looks really different in these scripts. See Tglg/Hano/Buhd/Tagb
  * Same for special cases of technically unicameral script: Cher, Geor
  * Aramaic-type scripts: Aleph
  * Brahmic scripts: K
  * Take another letter if Aleph/K is too basic, or too ornate, or that letter just better conveys script’s spirit. Examples: Arab — aleph is just a line. Maka — wanted a “bird”
* Icon MAY contain an Easter egg. Examples: alchemical symbols — water-alcohol mixture, early vodka. Cyrl ex — a letter looking like a word of Russian mat
* CJK: Hira, Kana and Kana phonetic are confirmed by a Japanese, and will no longer change
* For symbols: the most used, or the most iconic
* Repeat: ALL new icons will have placeholder colours instead of firm unless REALLY needed

## When Unicode transitions from beta to release:
* Go to ``MiscFiles/RawData`` and change addresses to final ones
* Load data, run AutoBuilder, replace files
* Delete LAST cached ``Blocks.txt`` from  ``BlockExtensionHistory`` build directory
* Check block extension history once again
* Do not forget to remove ``Vfg::BETA`` flag

## Adding really optional data Unicodia can live without
* Placeholders for emoji: see above
* Version texts. If the last version tells a story (an emergency release, a key person died, someone tried to hijack Unicode etc)…
  * Add ``Vfg::TEXT`` flag to this version
  * Write about this version in UTranslator. Again, original is English, the rest are translations
* Fonts
  * Find somehow, write in ``UcData.h``/``UcFonts.cpp``
  * There are two ways to write a font, tie to script or tie to block. Block is stronger, and I tie to script if possible
  * Modify block icon to permanent, see above
  * Do not forget to remove ``Ifg::MISSING``
  * When you remove this flag, synthesized icon will change, too. Do the following.
    * Find one of your new characters OR open Terms and scroll to Versions
    * Open your new Unicode version, click a tiny “Find” 🔍 icon next to # of new characters (now it’s the only, but things may change)
    * Find your block in search results, you’ll see a SYNTHESIZED icon. Make sure that icon is in harmony with hand-drawn 16×16, change ``synthIcon`` field if needed
* GlyphWiki’s placeholder of CJK fonts
  * (See GlyphWiki below)
* Latin in Library
  * AutoBuilder has some sort of forget-checker, and when the tofu is filled, you may write it to ``MiscFiles/library.xml`` and reduce number of forgotten characters

# Decapitalization rules
I repeat, decapitalization rules convert “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A” → “Latin capital letter A”.

There are several types of decapitalization rules, but the most frequent three are dictionary, idioms, script-specific and exceptions.

## Exceptions

* It means: human manually wrote how the text should decapitalize.
* If exception triggers, nothing else works.
* If string’s case is mixed, the rest rules are just skipped, but exceptions still work (see ``extractSynonym`` function).
* Otherwise first dictionary works, then idioms.
* Script-specific rules are just inserted somewhere.

## Dictionary

Some types of dictionary entries:
* Scripts (TRIG_SCRIPT, e.g. CYRILLIC): capitalize, trigger script-based rules
* Keywords (TRIG_CAP_NEXT, e.g. TONE): capitalize next to it
* Adjectives (PART_ADJECTIVE, e.g. BREATHY): if capitalized, push capitalization to the right
  * If chain of capitalization occurred, e.g. “letter Breathy long Foobar”, only the first adjective is capitalized
* Nouns (PART_NOUN, e.g. COMMA): if capitalization pushed, stop and do not capitalize: “letter Breathy long Foobar”, but “letter Breathy long comma”

## Idioms

Idioms are less powerful, work after dictionary, but trigger to several words at once, to correct capitalization at some phrase. Example: “Klingon vowel A”, but “Klingon vowel length mark”, just because “vowel length mark” cancels special meaning of “vowel” keyword.

## Script-specific

Right now only Cuneiform uses script-specific rules: e.g. “cuneiform sign LAM times KUR plus RU”. See line ``if (words[0].original == "CUNEIFORM"sv) {``

## Examples
1. Garay capital letter Ca
   * You should turn script mode on (it’ll automatically capitalize CA using keyword LETTER), and need one rule “GARAY”, flag TRIG_SCRIPT
1. Myanmar Eastern Pwo Karen digit Zero
   * Myanmar/Karen/Zero already work, but need to do something with “Eastern Pwo”, and need two-word script EASTERN+PWO
1. Ol Onal letter O
   * Already got two-word script “Ol Chiki”, but it’s possible to add “Ol Onal” to the same dictionary entry (AFAIR, up to 3 or 4 options)
1. Tulu-Tigalari letter A
   * If you just write as in example 1, it’ll automatically capitalize to “Tulu-tigalari”, and need a custom capitalization “Tulu-Tigalari”
1. Garay vowel length mark
   * Add idiom VOWEL LENGTH MARK
1. Tulu-Tigalari Vedic tone Svarita
   * Gagged with idiom VEDIC TONE
1. logic gate Or
   * You may make idiom LOGIC GATE. Or may add two exceptions
1. musical symbol With fingernails
   * Our rules misfire here (musical symbol “With fingernails” if have quotes), a clear exception!
1. Vedic tone Svarita
   * Exception, but why? It’s found in NamesList.txt in mixed case
1. Toto letter Breathy Iu
   * Two rules here, script TOTO and adjective BREATHY

# Font rebuilding
1. UnicodiaSesh — see ``FontSource\Egyptian2``.
1. UnicodiaHan — see ``GlyphWiki2\Data``.

# What do utilities do?
* AutoBuilder — build UcAuto.cpp from Unicode base.
  * **Warning**: transition to older/newer Unicode requires a bit of handwork.
* BlockExtensionHistory: 
* GwLoader — loads glyphs from GlyphWiki
* GwRemake — does an auto-remake of GlyphWiki
* PanoseTool — early tool that used to remove fonts’ declared script support. Left for history. Current Unicodia uses custom font loading code based on PanoseTool + font matching flags.
* QaCompareBmp — to check what changed in single-skintone emoji (e.g. changed repainting engine, stored→repainted)
* SmartCopy — copies the file if it actually differs.
* TapeMaker — creates a tape file for graphic emoji.
* [UTranslator](https://github.com/Mercury13/utranslator) — translation tool.

# Unicodia emoji style guide
If you decide to make a new character, there are two decisions available: 1) Mimic existing style; 2) Use new style. If you decide the latter (right now just three emoji have new style, placard and pushing hands)…

I discovered that most of professional emoji… do not work! Do not work because they have too much detail and too little contrast. The last professional emoji that really worked is… 2018 Microsoft!

**High priority:** emoji that are really badly grasped.

**Canvas size:** 64×64. For oblong/round object: leave 2px from edge. For square object: leave 6px from edge. For faces: leave 7px from edge.

**Colour scheme:** GNOME Human Interface Guidelines unless REALLY needed (e.g. military helmet). Use plain colours. Use black #000 and white #FFF sparingly, mainly for outlines and small details. Hands/people use Noto’s colours for skin.

**Projection:** frontal/sideways unless the object is better identified in other projection. Bilateral animals, vehicles and people face to the left.

**Style:** avoid toyish look. Machinery should be based on real-life models.

**Outline style:** outer 2px, the darkest colour of palette (unless outlining grey/white/luminous thing). Inner may be thinner if present. Butts are round for natural objects and square/slanted for boxy ones. Same for corners.

**Outline presence:** outer may be partly omitted to gain more dynamic look; the object should continue from the OUTER edge of outline (like in OpenMoji). Inner lines are mostly absent. White things are outlined more aggressively. Truncation lines are never outlined. You may omit outline of small outer details (e.g. hooves); but if they really define object’s shape, it’s better to outline them at least partly, at least with 1px. 

**Grid:** 1px; extremum nodes are snapped.

## Flags
These rules are intended to work around renderer deficiencies. Emoji are intended to be drawn in small size, and rendering SVG leaves half-pixel lines. Also white and black are main colours everywhere.

* Joining fields:
  * Fields always overlap to at least 1/16 width. Example (England): you just draw a white rectangle, and a cross over it.
  * When fields are large, that overlap should shun the edge: Example (Ukraine, Poland and other bicolours): one half is a rectangle, the other is a hexagon, with two vertices making that overlap.
* Colour scheme:
  * White is pure white FFF, black is Twitter black 141414.
* White fields adjacent to background:
  * Small (Norway, US): just white
  * Medium, both ends are of the same colour (Argentina, Oman): outline of that colour
  * Medium, ends have different colour (France, Luxembourg): grey outline
  * Large (England, Slovakia): also grey outline
  * Difference: small = white field makes a negative space rather than a hole; large = coloured outline makes too much visual noise
