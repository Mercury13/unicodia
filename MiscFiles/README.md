# SkinToneQa

**Purpose:** debugging skin tone auto-repainting

**When to run:** when changed at least one graphic emoji involving skin tone, see develop.md

# font_layout.txt

**Purpose:** debugging character→font mapping

**When to run:** when changed those things, or extended a font. Maybe I’ll auto-run during every build
